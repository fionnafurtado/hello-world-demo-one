<p>Lilium (/ˈlɪliəm/ LIL-ee-əm)[3] is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus">genus</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbaceous_plant">hernaceous flowering plants</a> growing from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers. They are the true lilies. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> and their range is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate">temperate climates</a> and extends into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics">subtropics.</a> Many other plants have "lily" in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_name">common names,</a> but do not belong to the same genus and are therefore not true lilies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<hr>
</p>
    <p>Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from 2–6 ft (60–180 cm). They form naked or tunicless scaly underground bulbs which are their organs of perennation. In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop stolons.[4] Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb, a number of species also produce contractile roots that move the bulbs deeper into the soil.[5]</p>

    <p>The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, as of January 2014, considers Nomocharis a separate genus in its own right,[15] however some authorities consider Nomocharis to be embedded within Lilium, rather than treat it as a separate genus.[16][17] The Sinomartagon are divided in 3 paraphyletic groups, while the Leucolirion are divided in 2 paraphyletic groups.[18]</p>
    <p>There are seven sections:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Martagon</li>
    <li>Pseudolirium</li> 
    <li>Liriotypus</li>
    <li>Archelirion</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Sinomartagon</li>
        <li>Leucolirion</li>
        <li>Daurolirion</li>
    </ol>
